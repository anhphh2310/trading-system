# Crypto Trading System

## Description
This project is a simple crypto trading system built with the Spring Boot framework and an in-memory H2 database. It allows users to trade between USDT and two supported cryptocurrencies: Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC). The system provides APIs for buying and selling, viewing wallet balances, checking trade history, and retrieving the latest aggregated prices from Binance and Huobi exchanges.

## Functional Scope
The system provides the following features:

1. **Crypto Trading (Buy/Sell)**: Users can buy and sell the supported crypto trading pairs.
2. **Trading History**: Users can view a list of all their trading transactions.
3. **Wallet Balance**: Users can view their wallet balance for supported cryptocurrencies and USDT.
